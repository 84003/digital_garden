- Ancestors used natural materials to create pictorial representations of their reality.
	- 30 000 years ago
	- Pictograms
		- symbols that resemble the physical object it represents.
		- important step in the evolution of writing

			- The Hunters palette depicts the struggle between humans and animals.
	- Idoegram
		- conceptual picture of an abstract idea
		- used to communicate messages, whereby one meaning combined with another meaning form a new meaning
- Earliest artifacts of the symbolic merging found in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), home of the Sumerians.
	- Earliest written documents were found here: clay accounting tablets.

			- This is an example of what is called protowriting. Conceptual meaning + conceptual meaning = new meaning. In this case, one sheep + ten notches = ten sheep.
- Rebus principle:
	- the use of existing symbols, such as pictograms, for their phonetic sound to represent new words.
	- Ancient writing systems used the rebus principle to represent abstract words that were difficult to represent with pictograms.
	- The Narmer Palette is an early example of this.
		- found along the Nile River in Egypt
		- dated around 31100 BC
		- containing hieroglyphic inscription

		- Between the two heads at the top there is an inscription of the name Narmer. It is written as a catfish, and a chisel, which translates to nar-mer.
