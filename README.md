## About This Jekyll Template

This Jekyll template is a way to organize and publish content directly from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to the web.

The workflow is Obsidian >> Github >> Netlify.

[Megumi Tanaka's](https://megumi.co) template, based on the [Jekyll digital garden template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt, was modified by me in 2022, following <a href="https://garden.megu.space/your-first-note.html#installation" class="internal-link">this guide</a>.

To install the Jekyll template, I followed the [steps delineated by megu](https://garden.megu.space/your-first-note.html#installation), with a few modifications, as seen below.

1. Create new respository from the [Github Template](https://github.com/meewgumi/digital-garden-apache-template) by clicking "Use this template"
2. Customize `_config.yml`
3. ~~Sign up for [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/r/nx7qct)~~
4. Connect Github repository to ~~DeployHQ~~ Netlify
5. Add your server's FTP or SSH information
6. Configure [Jekyll Build Commands](https://www.deployhq.com/guides/jekyll) on ~~DeployHQ~~ Netlify ~~and turn `vendor` caching on~~
7. Deploy.

In order to write and edit all entries in Obsidian, I followed [these steps](https://garden.megu.space/obsidian-setup.html).

I also added a staging area in the \_notes directory.
