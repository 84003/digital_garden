Welcome to my digital garden where I tend [information](http://127.0.0.1:4000/digital_garden/information) and thoughts. I'm an Obsidian native and thought I'd venture out to the online realm. The first subject I will be exploring is [[Information Theory]]. And here you can go to [Setup](https://ifonts.xyz/ogg-font-family.html) and to [Rebecca Rui](http://127.0.0.1:4000/digital_garden/rebecca-rui)

# One When I Need It

**Explicit internal connections** are content items that by convention take the form of a footnote or marginal annotations — the content of which can be a commentary on an idea, clarification of a term, parenthetical information and suchlike. **Explicit external connections** are inclusions of one document segment into another (what Nelson (1980) coined transclusions) or some other direct connection by way of reference. Interconnection thus implies multiple potential structures other than the paragraph-by-paragraph sequence of text.

## This is Heading Two

The **first section** of this entry introduces the concept of *interconnection*, the various terms used to express the idea of interconnection across fields, and the underlying philosophical position. The **second section** examines analog and digital systems developed throughout history, comprising concepts for representing interconnection. Those concepts are juxtaposed to how they have been implemented in commonly known systems, such as how hypertext is implemented on the Web.

### But Here is Heading Three

The motivation behind this approach resonates with what Mary Hopper stated:

> Consider that there may be vast potentials in electronic media that we still haven't implemented, and we may be in danger of missing some of the greatest potential in electronic media because we mistake some situational limitations in technical development or project management for impossibility.(Hopper 1998)

#### That's Right Heading Four

The concept of interconnection denotes the various connections among the content items[^content_item] of documents. As Ted Nelson (1987) explains, connections can be internal or external to a document, stated implicitly or explicitly. For example, phrases such as "in the example given below" or "as defined previously" establish **implicit internal connections**.

## And Two Again

Three examples are examined in detail to gather insight into which features of early systems can be utilized to create a construct based on accommodating interconnection.

1. The Encyclopédie by Denis Diderot and Jean d'Alembert.
2. The work of Paul Otlet.
3. The original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson.

The first two examples are both analog systems. The first is a closed system of internal connections, and the second is an exploration of an open system of connections based on a multidimensional structure. The third is a digital system based on a multidimensional and continuously evolving structure, envisioning the potential of the computer as a *literary machine* with consideration of its distinctive properties.[^distinctive_properties] All three examples share the conceptualization of documents as made up of parts that can be linked through some mechanism.

### 1 Encyclopédie by Diderot and d'Alembert

Various information technologies for mapping interconnection (non-)hierarchically were produced in the eighteenth century, ranging from atlases, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and suchlike. The Encyclopédie by Diderot and d'Alembert is a prominent example that, as Rosenberg (2015) argues, was an innovative system for its time. In its entirety, the Encyclopédie is a system of *intraconnections* — which is to say, a closed system of internal connections — "comprising 28 volumes, 72,000 articles by over 2,000 writers, and more than 3,000 plates" (Rosenberg 2015). Though the design incorporates concepts for representing external connections, the Encyclopédie was conceived and meant to be used as an independent system. A significant feature is the multiple renditions of the contents, offering multiple entry points to the articles. One structure of the Encyclopédie is the alphabetical structure, embedded as running headers throughout the encyclopedia (seen in the image below), allowing access to content by keyword.
